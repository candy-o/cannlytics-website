# Events

Cannlytics hosts meetups for like-minded individuals who are interested in learning about how to apply data science to cannabis data.


<!-- Learn to get cannabis data with an API. -->
<!-- Learn how to get, wrangle, and analyze cannabis data. Utilize the web and API's to get the data you need. Wrangle the data like a pro into a format suitable for analysis. Then, calculate statistics to your heart's galore. Furthermore, learn how to build forecasting and prediction models to get an upper-hand on your competition.

At the Cannabis Data Science meetup, you can join like-minded individuals, learn about modern data science techniques, and go through hands-on exercising with real cannabis data. This is a great opportunity for anyone in a cannabis-testing lab, anyone working at a cannabis cultivation or processing plant, any cannabis retailer, and even any cannabis researcher or consumer seeking knowledge.

Please join us for a coffee, I like tea, every Wednesday at 8:30am for a fun time crunching cannabis numbers. -->


<!-- Meetup Philosophy -->
<!-- Meetup is all about helping people live fuller,
happier lives—with the help of strong communities.
This means that all groups should:

Provide growth opportunities for members
Encourage real human interactions in person or online
Have a host present at all events
Be transparent about the group's intentions
Here are the five key tenets of our community on social media:

Be welcoming. Cultivate a space where everyone feels safe to be themselves: a community driven by kindness — not bullying, trolling, or bigotry.
Be real. Act as you would act in real life: with integrity and authenticity.
Be impactful. Contribute to the discussion, and respect everyone’s time. What would you say if you were talking in person at an event?
Be spirited. Show up with an openness to diverse perspectives and lively debate.
Be thoughtful. Challenge ideas, not people.

All members should be open about who they are, their intentions, and their affiliations. All group and event descriptions should be accurate, so members can make informed decisions about their participation. -->

<!-- Meetup members and organizers must be at least 21 years of age. -->

<!-- Please refrain from promotional content during the meetup -->

<!-- Privacy -->
<!-- Posting other people's private information without their explicit consent is prohibited. …

Members and organizers should always be mindful of privacy and use discretion when sharing any private content that belongs to themselves or to other members. For example, phone numbers, social security numbers, addresses, financial information, passwords, and government identification are considered private information. -->
