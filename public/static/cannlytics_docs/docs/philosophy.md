# Philosophy

You deserve to control your software.

Anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it.

## [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

We believe that everyone benefits when people are able to study and tinker with their software.

"users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software." "everyone deserves these freedoms"

With the freedom provided by Cannlytics, users (both individually and collectively) control the software and what it does for them.

Cannlytics strives to provide you with 4 essential freedoms:

  1. The freedom to run Cannlytics as you wish, for any purpose.
  2. The freedom to study how Cannlytics works, change how it works, and modify the [source code](https://github.com/cannlytics).
  3. The freedom to redistribute copies of Cannlytics.
  4. The freedom to distribute your modified versions of Cannlytics software to others.

By providing you with these freedoms, the whole community has a chance to benefit from your changes.

Cannlytics freedom helps ensure your privacy and guarantee that there are no malicious processes. You have complete control. You can compare versions and change anything that you don't like.

"So if you are redistributing copies of free software, you might as well charge a substantial fee and *make some money*. Redistributing free software is a good and legitimate activity; if you do it, you might as well make a profit from it."

We believe that in addition to using Cannlytics software, you should be able to read, fix, adapt, and improve the software.

### Donate

Cannlytics is free software and a community project. Donating to the Cannlytics organization advance the world of free software.


### Contribute

One important way to modify a program is by merging in available free subroutines and modules. You have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they exist. If you do publish your changes, you are not required to notify anyone in particular, or in any particular way.


### Community

The community is free to make and distribute modified versions of Cannlytics with new functionality or without arbitrary nuisance code.

Free software naturally tends to spread around and you are encouraged to share all or a portion of the Cannlytics software suite.


## Privacy

Cannlytics doesn't ask for personal information when you sign up for an account. All personal data saved in the Cannlytics system are [hashed](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/180/4/final) and rendered unidentifiable by Cannlytics developers.

You control your data. Your data is not for sale. Your data is private.

## Zen

## Keep it simple stupid! (K.I.S.S. ðŸ’‹)

Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.

"Make it simple first."

We believe that simplicity is a key component in good design.

At the end of the day, your laboratory needs to perform analyses.

One of the reasons that Cannlytics uses Django is because we share [a common philosophy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/faq/general/#framework-x-does-feature-y-why-doesn-t-django). Cannlytics, like Django, "was developed precisely because we were unhappy with the status quo."

We believe that simplicity leads to a quick development cycle.

## Think for yourself

Cannlytics believes that you can make the best decisions for yourself and will not tell you what you must do. Cannlytics does believe that there should be 1 and preferably only 1 way to do things, however, you are free to do things as you please. Cannlytics provides defaults and suggestions for how to operate the Cannlytics Engine, but ultimately you are in control and are encouraged to think for yourself.

"Choose the right tool for the job."

## Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

This principle extends to many domains, however, it principally refers to re-using code and writing as much as possible.

"Every distinct concept and/or piece of data should live in one, and only one, place."

## Infinite flexibility

Ultimately, Cannlytics is meant to solve cannabis-testing problems expediently. Use your best judgment to bend Cannlytics to your will.

## Assume developer competence

Cannlytics assumes that developers are competent and does not force crutches upon them. Software crutches, such as WordPress, are too severe of a limitation for Cannlytics and would hamstring the project. Cannlytics begins with the assumption that you are a smart, well-reasoning human being competent of good decision making. If you want to modify Cannlytics to use tools that assume developer incompetence, then you are free to do so.


## Extensibility

All labs are different have have different analytical and regulatory requirements. Therefore, Cannlytics aims to provide a system that works out of the box, but is fully extendable to new features and functionality.

## Configuration over scripting

Users seem to prefer declarative configuring over scripting.


<!-- ## Absolutism

A Pythonic principle is that there should be one, and preferably only one way to do something. At Cannlytics, we may be absolutist about certain things, however, that does not mean that you are not free to implement the Cannlytics Engine exactly as you desire, with modifications. -->
