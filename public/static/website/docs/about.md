# What is Cannlytics?

Cannlytics provides a cannabis analytics platform that anyone can use to their advantage. Cannlytics' mission is to help people in the lab, who work with labs, who sell lab-tested products, and final consumers to access lab data easier. Cannlytics helps superpower cannabis-testing labs with free and ethical cannabis-testing software made with love. Cannlytics greatly improves laboratory operations, increasing the number of samples that labs can test, reducing turnaround time, and freeing analyst to spend more time doing science. Cannlytics provides a user-friendly interface to quickly receive samples, perform analyses, collect and review results, and publish certificates of analysis (CoAs). There are also built in logistics, CRM (client relationship management), inventory management, and invoicing tools. The platform is rich with analytics specifically designed for cannabis analytics.

Cannlytics is a healthy mix of user friendly interfaces and software that you can use in your cannabis-testing lab. Users do not have to have any advanced knowledge and can jump in at any point. There are many advanced features that people with background in the web stack, Python, or your favorite programming language can jump right into. The Cannlytics Website provides people with information about Cannlytics. The Cannlytics Engine is a mobile, desktop, and web app that provides administrators, laboratory staff, laboratory clients, and client integrators to interact with laboratory information.

## History

The story of Cannlytics began when I, Keegan Skeate, <img height="24" width="24" alt="" src="https://cannlytics.com/static/cannlytics_website/images/logos/keeganskeate-robohash-human.png"> went out on a limb and took a job as a laboratory analyst after finishing my studies in economics. Data entry frustrated me as a lab analyst because it kept me from doing more interesting work in the lab, where I often got to work with senior chemists on experiments (method development).

I realized that we could create greater efficiencies with cannabis testing software and decided that rather than wait for someone else to invent one, that I was in the best position to develop a program because I was so close to existing  systems. I went about creating an elegant program based on design thinking principles that reduced the number of clicks in order to create efficiencies, simplicity and speed.

Now, starting entirely from scratch, I have started a collaborative build of a LIMS for cannabis-testing labs that can provide a faster, simpler, and easier to use system that provides true traceability.

Cannlytics exists to make people in the cannabis industry and people who use cannabis lives better. By generating, tracing, and delivering lab results with true traceability, Cannlytics empowers consumers to choose products that are free from pesticides and other contaminants.

Cannlytics streamlines the lab testing process for cannabis, allowing everyone in the supply chain to maximize the value of their lab data. Cannlytics helps ensure that cannabis lab tests are accurate and transparent, boosting consumer safety.

I want to help people access the lab data that they need to make better decisions, from people in the lab, to their clients, to their clientâ€™s retailers, and to the end consumer.

## Why Cannlytics?

**Why does Cannlytics exist?** To make people in the cannabis industry and people who use cannabis lives better.

**What problem is Cannlytics trying to solve?** Generating, tracing, and delivering lab results.

Cannlytics aims to make your cannabis-testing operations efficient, reliable, and fun by automating all nuisance tasks and letting you focus on the science.

* Information to point you in the right direction for learning about Cannlytics.
* The Cannlytics Engine puts a lot at your fingertips.
* The program is free regardless of the price, because users have freedom in using it.

Streamlining processes. Allow everyone in the supply chain to maximize the value of their lab data.

Reduce delay and waste.

Improve the laboratory process by saving time on every test.

Cannlytics is easy to integrate into your lab.

Cannlytics offers simplicity and automation in cannabis testing software program for cannabis-testing labs to increase productivity and advance cannabis science.

Simple
Scientific
Accurate
Human-centered

You have a limited bandwidth, so, let Cannlytics manage your data connectivity. A full suite of testing required for quality assurance testing. The aim is to minimize the number of clicks, learning from pain points in my past. Labs want a fully customizable CoA and integration with the state traceability system. We want producers to demand to user our software.

1.	Get testing as precise as possible.
2.	Let consumers make informed decisions.
3.	Ensure results match labels.

There is not a lot of research available. Cannlytics can provide analysis of historical data. Consumers rely on results, but it is difficult to see prior results. Cannlytics can provide transparency into results. Ultimately, we need to get CoAs to consumers. Minimize communication time.


### Why test cannabis?

In Washington state, "Anecdotal and limited scientific evidence indicates that the use of marijuana may be beneficial to alleviate the symptoms of certain physical and mental conditions. However, due to the current federal classification of marijuana as a schedule 1 controlled substance, scientific research has not been performed that would allow for standardized indications of particular strains, which can vary radically in cannabinoid composition; standard, reproducible formula or dosage; or accepted standards for drug purity, potency and quality for the various conditions for which the medical use of marijuana may be authorized. At this time, the decision of what marijuana products may be beneficial is best made by patients in consultation with their health care practitioners. For this reason, the department will not limit the types of products available to qualifying patients. Instead, the department intends to create standards for products that any consumer can rely upon to be reasonably safe and meet quality assurance measures."

## Who owns Cannlytics?

[You](https://github.com/cannlytics).

## Where can I use Cannlytics?

You can use Cannlytics every place where you need to interact with your laboratory data.

Interface with state traceability.

## How can I use Cannlytics?

You can either [download the Cannlytics engine](https://github.com/cannlytics) and setup your own platform or you can pay the Cannlytics team to setup your platform in a short amount of time.

Traceability that goes above and beyond state traceability.

Keep track of instrument maintenance to minimize instrument upkeep costs.

Paperwork, quality control, traceability, and inventory management are costly. Variable goods (standards) are expensive and it is important to keep track of what is on hand and ensure it is stored properly. Bench sheets can be messy and lead to poor traceability.

Auditable open source software.
