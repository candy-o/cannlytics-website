Cannlytics hosts meetups for like-minded individuals who are interested in learning about how to apply data science to cannabis data.


<!-- Learn to get cannabis data with an API. -->
<!-- Learn how to get, wrangle, and analyze cannabis data. Utilize the web and API's to get the data you need. Wrangle the data like a pro into a format suitable for analysis. Then, calculate statistics to your heart's galore. Furthermore, learn how to build forecasting and prediction models to get an upper-hand on your competition.

At the Cannabis Data Science meetup, you can join like-minded individuals, learn about modern data science techniques, and go through hands-on exercising with real cannabis data. This is a great opportunity for anyone in a cannabis-testing lab, anyone working at a cannabis cultivation or processing plant, any cannabis retailer, and even any cannabis researcher or consumer seeking knowledge.

Please join us for a coffee, I like tea, every Wednesday at 8:30am for a fun time crunching cannabis numbers. -->
