# Using ARCH Models to Predict Processed Product Inconsistencies

This exercise utilizes data from X laboratory tests of processed products in Washington State between X and X.

# Processor Data and Statistics

First things first, it is interesting to know which extraction techniques are being used and the prevalence of each technique over time. Calculating the proportion of samples being tested that were extracted by the various techniques gives us an idea if any of the techniques are becoming more or less popular over time.

You can also look at the various techniques that a single processor may use. This can answer the question as to if any of the processors are using multiple extraction techniques. If a processor switches from one technique to another or relies more on one of their extraction techniques over time, then this may indicate profitable extraction techniques.

When considering profitable extraction techniques, the variability of the cannabinoid concentrations in the product comes to mind. You can look at the average concentration of total cannabinoids and by specific cannabinoid to get an idea of the efficacy over various extraction techniques and you can look at the standard deviation in the cannabinoids to get an idea of the consistency of each technique.

You can also look at the average concentration and variance in concentration from processor to processor.

With this data, it is straight-forward to forecast their performance and variability into the future. Using data from X to X, a prediction of samples tested, average concentration, and variance in concentration can be made for each processor. This allows an estimate of industry performance and to gauge which processors will be the most successful in 2022.

## Forecasting Methods

An ARCH model can be used to estimate variance, which can be interpreted as inconsistencies in products. Anecdotally, processors are concerned with minimizing their variability because a wider variance in concentration leads to higher costs and less consumer trust.
