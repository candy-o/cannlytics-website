# Economic Analysis

Economics is one of our top comparative advantages. We do great, thorough economic analysis at a price so low that it makes our competitors quake in their boots. Why would you overpay tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars on simple economic  analysis that Cannlytics can deliver to you at the fraction of our competitors' costs.

Economics is simply the study of choice. How, what, where, when, and why your customers will purchase your products, how you can optimally choose vendors or even who to employ, and what is your best business decision given everyone elses' best business decisions are all questions that economic analysis can help you answer.
