# Forecasting Solutions

Prediction is an uncertain science, but we believe that the best forecast for the future is a hell of a lot better than no forecast at all. There is absolutely no need to fly blindly into the future when you can use simple statistical techniques to get a surprisingly good forecast of almost any metric that you can measure.

Cannlytics practices, preaches, and strictly adheres to the 10 commandments of forecasting:

Reference:

If you have key performance indicators (KPIs), market conditions, or anything at all that you would benefit from having a forecast of, then Cannlytics can deliver a forecast to you so fast and at such a low marginal cost that we believe in short time that you'll be hard pressed to have any data that you don't want forecasted into the future.

We are always improving our forecasting models, learning from our forecasts, and would be thrilled to integrate automatic forecasting and predictions into your workflow. From our experience, the one thing administrators love more than a Cannlytics economic analysis is an automatic Cannlytics economic analysis with accompanying forecasts arriving promptly in their inbox at the exact same time it always has for weeks on end. We would love to do just that for you and at a price so low it would be crazy not to have a Cannlytics forecasting algorithm (or two or three) in your toolbelt, ticking along as steady as can be and giving you a major leg up on your competition.
