# Join the Community

Cannlytics believes that everyone benefits when they have the freedom to make the best of themselves. Therefore, Cannlytics is built with **community-driven development**, putting resources in your hands. Community-driven development is a bottom-up, demand-driven approach to the development process. The **5** key principles of community-driven development are:

1. Community focus.
2. Participatory planning.
3. Community control of resources.
4. Community involvement.
5. Community-based monitoring and evaluation.

The aim of community-driven development is to improve **functionality**, **accountability**, **sustainability**, **security**, and **transparency**. Community-driven development also promotes participation, collaboration, equity, inclusiveness, nondiscrimination, efficiency, and benevolence. Community-driven development empowers laboratories to grow quickly and efficiently. Overall, community-driven development helps reduce corruption, misuse of resources, and inefficiencies. Compared to a closed system, the Cannlytics community provides better quality, easier maintenance, and a more efficient use of resources. In the long-run, community-driven development will help you lower costs, increase transparency, and promote accountability.
